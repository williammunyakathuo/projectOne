#Project One

My first step back into web development

This project marks my return to learning and building full stack applications. It is a personal reset and a commitment to grow consistently as a developer. My goal is to sharpen my skills and create real projects that show my progress over time.

What this project represents

A fresh reset
Consistency in learning
Hands on practice
Building real things from scratch

I want to become a confident full stack developer. This repository will track my journey from day one as I learn, improve and expand my abilities.

I am grateful to FreeCodeCamp.org for providing high quality learning resources. I am currently following their tutorial titled Become a Fullstack Developer from Scratch Full Beginner’s Tutorial.
Through this guided path, I will build hireable skills in the JavaScript ecosystem, including

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React
Node.js
Next.js
TypeScript
Databases
Testing

Why this matters

This journey is more than learning code. It is about rebuilding momentum, developing discipline, and creating a solid foundation for future projects and opportunities. I am taking this one day at a time and making steady progress that I can be proud of.
